    By combining semantic embeddings with real visual features, the generator
is trained to enhance the correlation between synthetic features and their
corresponding categories. Class prototypes are computed based on real
features and contrastive loss guides the constraint of synthetic feature
distribution, improving model performance. Additionally, the algorithm
incorporates Pseudo Margin Evaluation loss to calculate instance uncertainty scores and increase discrimination power.

**Novel Instance Mining with Pseudo-Margin Evaluation for Few-Shot Object Detection**<br />
Liu, Weijie, Chong Wang, Shenghao Yu, **Chenchen Tao**, Jun Wang, and Jiafei Wu<br />
*ICASSP*, 2023<br />

  <div style="width：70%">
    A new instance mining model is proposed to excavate the novel samples from the base set. The detector 
    is thus fine-tuned again by these additional free novel 
    instances. Meanwhile, a novel pseudo-margin evaluation
    algorithm is designed to address the quality problem of 
    pseudo-labels brought by those new novel instances.
