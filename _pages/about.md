I'm a postgraduate student in Computer Science at Ningbo University. I'll receive my master's degree in 2024. I received my bachelor's degree from Dalian University.

My research interests are generally in machine learning, video understanding, and multimodality models, with a particular focus on weakly-supervised/unsupervised video anomaly detection, few-shot object detection, and masked video modeling for action recognition.
