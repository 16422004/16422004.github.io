    A new instance mining model is proposed to excavate the novel samples from the base set. The detector 
    is thus fine-tuned again by these additional free novel 
    instances. Meanwhile, a novel pseudo-margin evaluation
    algorithm is designed to address the quality problem of 
    pseudo-labels brought by those new novel instances.
