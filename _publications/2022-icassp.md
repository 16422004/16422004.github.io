A new instance mining model is proposed to excavate the novel samples from the base set. The detector 
is thus fine-tuned again by these additional free novel 
instances. Meanwhile, a novel pseudo-margin evaluation
algorithm is designed to address the quality problem of 
pseudo-labels brought by those new novel instances.
